# Implementation Details

Each repository in this catalog contains implementations of specific machine learning techniques and algorithms. The following information is provided for each repository:

- **Repository Link**: Direct link to the GitHub repository
- **Description**: Brief introduction to the repository's purpose and links to relevant research papers
- **Algorithms**: List of ML algorithms demonstrated in the repository
- **Datasets**: Information on datasets used, with links to publicly available data
- **Type**: The category of implementation:
    * **bootcamp**: Educational implementations developed for workshops and learning purposes
    * **tool**: Utility libraries and tools for broader use
    * **applied-research**: Research code tied to specific projects or papers
- **Year**: The year the implementation was published

## Usage Notes

!!! note
    - Many repositories contain code for reference purposes only. To run them, updates may be required to the code and environment files.
    - Links for only publicly available datasets are provided. Many datasets used in the repositories are only available on the Vector cluster.

## Repository Organization

The catalog is organized by implementation type to help you quickly find the resources you need:

* **Bootcamp implementations**: Educational resources designed for workshops and learning purposes
* **Tool implementations**: Utility libraries and general-purpose tools
* **Applied Research implementations**: Code tied to specific research projects or papers

Each implementation includes algorithm tags, dataset information, and other metadata to aid in discovery.
